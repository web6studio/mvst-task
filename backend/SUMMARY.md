## Backend Implementation

### Core Functionality

- ✅ Complete CRUD operations for coffee management
- ✅ Proper error handling with custom exceptions
- ✅ Input validation using class-validator
- ✅ Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for requests and responses

### Database Layer

- ✅ PostgreSQL integration with TypeORM
- ✅ Database migrations for schema management
- ✅ Initial data seeding

### Code Quality & Testing

- ✅ Unit tests for services and controllers
- ✅ End-to-end (E2E) tests for API endpoints
- ✅ Comprehensive logging system
  - Application startup logging
  - CRUD operations logging
  - Error tracking
  - Different log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- ✅ Clean code architecture following SOLID principles
  - Single Responsibility: Each service and controller has a single purpose (CoffeeService handles only coffee-related logic)
  - Open/Closed: Using DTOs and entities that can be extended without modification
  - Liskov Substitution: Proper use of inheritance in DTOs (CoffeeResponseDto)
  - Interface Segregation: Clean interfaces for repositories and services
  - Dependency Inversion: Using dependency injection throughout the application
- ✅ Dependency injection pattern
  - Repository injection in CoffeeService (@InjectRepository(Coffee))
  - Service injection in CoffeeController (@Injectable())
  - Configuration injection for database and CORS settings

### Configuration & Setup

- ✅ CORS configuration for frontend integration
- ✅ Environment-based configuration
- ✅ Updated dependencies to latest stable versions
- ✅ Clear project structure
- ✅ Updated README with setup instructions

## Technical Stack

- NestJS as the backend framework
- TypeScript for type-safe development
- PostgreSQL for data storage
- TypeORM for database operations
- Jest for testing
- Docker for development environment

## Future Improvements

While the current implementation is comprehensive for a coding challenge, potential improvements could include:

- API documentation with Swagger
- Caching layer
- CI/CD pipeline
- Performance monitoring
- Rate limiting
- Authentication and authorization
